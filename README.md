### Task 1: Setup

1. Create a new ASP.NET Core Web Application using either Visual Studio or Visual Studio Code.
2. Choose the "Web Application" template with ASP.NET Core 3.1 or later.
3. Use the MVC pattern for organizing your code.

### Task 2: Database

1. Create a simple database schema for a blog system with two entities: `Post` and `Author`.
   - `Post` should have fields: `Id`, `Title`, `Content`, `PublicationDate`, and `AuthorId` (foreign key).
   - `Author` should have fields: `Id`, `Name`, `Email`.

2. Set up Entity Framework Core to work with your database.
   - Use migrations to create the database tables.

### Task 3: CRUD Operations

1. Implement a controller for managing blog posts (`PostsController`).
   - Include actions for listing all posts, displaying a single post, creating a new post, updating a post, and deleting a post.

2. Implement corresponding views for these actions.
   - Use Razor syntax for rendering HTML.

### Task 4: Validation

1. Implement validation for creating and updating posts.
   - Ensure that the `Title` and `Content` fields are required.
   - Display appropriate error messages in the views if validation fails.

### Task 5: Authentication

1. Implement a simple authentication mechanism.
   - Allow users to register and login.
   - Only authenticated users should be able to create, update, or delete posts.

### Submission

1. Share your code repository (e.g., GitHub) with the interviewer.
2. Include a brief README explaining how to run the application and any additional notes you want to provide.

### Additional Notes

- Pay attention to code organization, readability, and best practices.
- Use asynchronous programming where appropriate.
- Think about security considerations, especially when dealing with user authentication.
- Feel free to use any additional libraries or tools you find necessary.

This assignment is designed to assess your ability to work with ASP.NET, Entity Framework, MVC, and basic authentication concepts. Good luck! If you have any questions, don't hesitate to ask.
